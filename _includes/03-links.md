Here are a few links

  * Firstly, a link to [my GitHub Pages](https://dar-72.github.io/markdown-portfolio/)
  * Secondly, a link to [Codecademy](https://codecademy.com), since they brought me here, so I feel it's only fair to give them a shout-out
  * Third, my current academic profile on the Uni webspace [404](https://dar-72.github.io/markdown-portfolio/404.html)
  * Finally, an older academic profile on a previous Uni that I attended [404](https://dar-72.github.io/markdown-portfolio/404.html)
    * I think I should still have a website on the .cam.ac.uk webpages somewhere too, but I honestly can't rememeber
